    "### STAR WAYS EXIT SURVEYS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that `“The Empire Strikes Back”` is clearly the best of the bunch?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this,  Star Wars fans were surveyed using the online tool SurveyMonkey. A total of 835 total responses was received. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "The goal of this project is to answer questions about the `Star Wars Movie` for its fans. This dataset  will be cleaned and explored in this project. "
